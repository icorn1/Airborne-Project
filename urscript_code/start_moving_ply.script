# Discription to function start_moving_ply()
# This function opens a connection to Host, this is the PC used. It sends the command 
# "moving" to the PC so that the PC knows which function is being run. The ply ID is
# send to the PC. The PC will send the location of the ply with the right ply ID back.
# If the ply is not found, an error_code of 1 is returned by the PC and the UR will go
# to the GUI and there it will ask if you want to skip the ply or chose a new one to fill
# the place of the missing ply. when the robot is at the ply (error_code = 0) it will
# send a command to the PC to activate the tool end, which consists of vacu√ºm cups.
# After this the robot moves to where the composite should be build.
